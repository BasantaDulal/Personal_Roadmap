After completing my studies which was bachelors in Business Studies in Finance, I joined Citizens Bank International Ltd. Kathmandu, Nepal in 2015. Initially, I start working in a Branch office as a Teller. But after a month, the management come to know that I am good with Excel and preparing Reports. So, they transfer me to Credit Administrative Department at Head Office. There I started working as a Business Analyst. During my job I performed following Tasks.

1. Perform SQL query to obtain data from server.
2. Collect various required data from branch office and departments, then compile and cleanse that to prepare reports.
3. Prepare various reports related to credit required by Central Bank.
4. Prepare and provide different credit related reports requested by various department for their decision making.
5. Prepare dashboards based on credit related data using PowerBI and report the key insights to Finance Department.
6. Write requirements to update and customize the banking software i.e. Finacle.
7. Perform UAT testing after the customization has been made in software and report the acceptance or required changes.

My most of the work as a Business Analyst was related to data. Because of that, my interest in data increased day by day and I start searching career oportunities in this field. Then, I found that a person can switch the work as a Data Analyst after acquiring certain skills. So, I decided to join a Data Analytic course. As there were no courses related to data in our country, I have to go abroad for my studies. After doing some research, I found going to Canada viable and did necessary processing. Then, I left my job and fly to canada to persue necessary studies.

During my job, I also completed my Masters in Business Studies as a Finance major. I also understand different financial concepts and use some of them during my work as well. In my masters, there was also statistics course, which gave me strong statistical foundation. Those statistical concepts are now assets in my Data Analytics journey.

Currently, I am studying Data Analytics for Business Decision Making at Durham College. During my study, I have gain various skills and learn different tools. I learned Python and R programing language for data wrangling and model building. Further, I am also learning Power BI and Tableau as a data transformation and visualization tool. Lastly, the most important skill required for data analysis that I have learned is SQL. Further, this program will be completed in December 2022 and I am going to take another AI course from January 2023 to enhance my current skills.

In addition to this course, I am also doing SQL, Pythton and PowerBI certification in Udemy. I believe that this certifications will help me to showcase my skills to potential employers.

To further enhance my current skills, I am planning to join Artificial Intelligence Analysis, Design and Implementation course at Durham College in January 2023. This program will be eight months of study and four months of Co-op. I believe that,this program will make me more comfortable with programing skills and teaches me more about machine learning models. After completing eight months of studies, I will join a co-op in a company where I will use my current skills and knowlede to get a real world experience. This Co-op will also be helpful to get a canadian experience which is seek by the employers in the industry. I will start applying for jobs during my Co-op so that I will get the Data Analyst job by the time my Co-op is completed.
