After completeing my Studies which was bachelors in Business Studies in Finance, I joined Citizens Bank International Ltd. Kathmandu, Nepal in 2015. Initially, I start working in a Branch office as a Teller. But after a month, they come to know that I was good at Excel and making Reports. So, they transfer me to Credit Administrative Department at Head Office. There I started working as a Business Analyst.During my job I used to perform following Tasks.

1. Perform SQL query to obtain data from server.
2. Collect various required data from branch office and departments, then compile and cleanse that to prepare reports.
3. Prepare various reports related to credit required by Central Banks.
4. Prepare and provide different credit related reports requested by various department for their decision making.
5. Prepare dashboards based on credit related data using PowerBI and report the key insights to Finance Department.
6. Write the requirements to improve the banking software i.e. Finacle.
7. Do the UAT testing after the update has been made in software and report the acceptance or changes required regarding CBS update.

My most of the work in as a Business Analyst was related to data. So, my interest in data become more and more day by day and I start searching career oportunities in this field. Then, I come to know that a person can switch the work as a Data Analyst after acquiring certain skills. So, I decided to join a Data Analytic course. As there were no courses related to data in our country, I have to go abroad for my studies. After doing some research, I find going to Canada viable and do necessary processing and left my job to persue necessary studies.

During my job, I also completed my Masters in Business Studies as a Finance major. I also understand different financial concepts and use some of them during my work as well. In my masters, there was also statistics course, which give me strong statistical foundation. Those statistical concepts are now assets in my Data Analytics journey.

This program will be eight months of study and four months of co-op. This program will make me more comfortable with programing skills and make more familier to machine learning skills.
