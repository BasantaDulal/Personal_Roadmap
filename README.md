After completeing my Studies which was bachelors in Business Studies in Finance, I joined Citizens Bank International Ltd. Kathmandu, Nepal in 2015. Initially, I start working in a Branch office as a Teller. But after a month, they come to know that I was good at Excel and making Reports. So, they transfer me to Credit Administrative Department at Head Office. There I started working as a Business Analyst.During my job I used to perform following Tasks.

1. Perform SQL query to obtain data from server.
2. Collect various required data from branch office and departments, then compile and cleanse that to prepare reports.
3. Prepare various reports related to credit required by Central Banks.
4. Prepare and provide different credit related reports requested by various department for their decision making.
5. Prepare dashboards based on credit related data using PowerBI and report the key insights to Finance Department.
6. Write the requirements to improve the banking software i.e. Finacle.
7. Do the UAT testing after the update has been made in software and report the acceptance or changes required regarding CBS update.


### Data Cleansing
In order to cleanse the data, I used Tableau Prep Builder. The duplicate values were removed and the abbrivated name of Transmission and Fuel type were decoded from the metadata sheet. After, this the dataset looks good for further process. In the second visual, we are trying to examine the relationship between Fuel Consumption and CO2 emission so, scatterplots would be the best option for that.
